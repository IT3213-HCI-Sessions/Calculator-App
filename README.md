# Calculator App Project - Step-by-Step Development üßÆ

This repository contains the step-by-step development of a **Calculator App** using **Axure RP 9**. Each week, new features and interactions will be added until the app is fully functional. Below is the progress and details of the current session (**Day 02**).

## Project Overview üöÄ
The goal of this project is to build a fully functional calculator app with a user-friendly interface and interactive features. The development will be done in **Axure RP 9**, and this repository will be updated weekly to reflect the latest progress.

## Day 02 Progress - Basic Interface and Number Pad Interactions üñ•Ô∏è

### Features Added in Day 02:
1. **Basic Calculator Interface**:
   - A simple calculator layout with a screen and a number pad (0-9).
   - Buttons for numbers (0-9) and basic operations (to be added in future sessions).

2. **Interactions for Number Pad (0-9)**:
   - Interactions are added to update the calculator screen when a number is clicked.
   - Two variables are created:
     - **Flag**: Used to determine whether to replace or join the input.
     - **Saved Number**: Used to store the current input value.

3. **Initial Variable Setup**:
   - When the page is loaded:
     - Set **Flag** to `"Replace"`.
     - Set **Saved Number** to `""` (empty string).

4. **Interaction Logic for Numbers (1-9)**:
   - **Case 01**: If the value of **Flag** equals `"Replace"`:
     - Set the calculator screen text to `[[This.text]]` (the clicked number).
     - Set **Flag** to `"Join"`.
   - **Case 02**: If the value of **Flag** equals `"Join"`:
     - Set the calculator screen text to `[[Target.text]][[This.text]]` (append the clicked number to the existing text).

5. **Interaction Logic for Number 0**:
   - **Case 01**: If the value of **Flag** equals `"Replace"`:
     - Set the calculator screen text to `"0"`.
   - **Case 02**: If the value of **Flag** equals `"Join"`:
     - Set the calculator screen text to `[[Target.text]][[This.text]]` (append `0` to the existing text).
